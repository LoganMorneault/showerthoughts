# ShowerThoughts

ShowerThoughts is a social media platform for users to share the deep thoughts that they come up with in their most intimate moments: butt naked in the shower. ShowerThoughts is a text-only service that allows users to create and view posts from other users. Users with a certain number of post interactions are designated Shower Philosophers; these users can monetize their posts and have access to deeper analytics than the average user. A viewerâ€™s post feed has advertisements included with the user-generated content; advertisers have access to post analytics similar to a Shower Philosopher, but they spend money to share their content instead of receiving it.
